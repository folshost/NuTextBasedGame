I started this project in offline mode while on a plane. Then I decided to kinda keep working on it, adding a proper CMAKE environment for it, mainly as a learning activity. I will probably keep on adding on to make it into a full-fledged software development learning example, with stuff like CircleCI tests and other stuff. Or I'll just leave it unattended. Hopefully not.
